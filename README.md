Developed with Unreal Engine 5

# 🎮 LyraALS: Advanced Locomotion System Inspired Project in Unreal Engine 5

A fully modular, animation-driven third-person gameplay system built with Unreal Engine 5 — inspired by Lyra and Advanced Locomotion System (ALS). Designed to showcase AAA-quality locomotion, firearm mechanics, VFX/audio systems, and a polished UI layer.

---

## 🧭 Overview

This project is a deep dive into professional-grade animation and gameplay flow in Unreal Engine 5. It builds upon the foundational principles of Epic's Lyra and ALS systems to create a responsive, scalable, and production-ready character controller and combat system.

## 💡 Why This Project?

This project was created to understand and recreate the responsiveness and polish of AAA locomotion systems — similar to what you’d find in *Alan Wake 2* or *The Last of Us*. Key areas of focus include:

- Smooth animation blending with **distance matching**
- Real-time gameplay feedback via **sync groups and montage layering**
- Clean modular code and Blueprint structure for **reusability and scalability**

---

## 🧪 Technologies & Tools

- Unreal Engine 5.3.2+
- Blueprints + C++ hybrid architecture
- PCG framework
- Behavior Trees & AIController
- Animation Montages, Blendspaces, Layered Blend Per Bone
- Widget UI, Gameplay Tags, and Modular Input Mapping

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `LyraALS.uproject` in Unreal Engine 5.3.2+
3. Run the `ALS_Character` map
4. Use WASD + mouse to control, test jump, aim, shoot, and observe smooth transitions
